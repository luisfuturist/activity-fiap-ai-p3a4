# TODO.md for Agricultural Data Analysis Project

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- [x] Obtain the dataset and ensure it is properly loaded into the Jupyter Notebook.
- [x] Clean the dataset:
  - [x] Handle missing values.
  - [x] Check for and address any data inconsistencies.
- [x] Conduct exploratory data analysis to familiarize with the data.

## Descriptive Analysis

- [ ] Generate at least five descriptive graphs to visualize key findings.
- [ ] Write a narrative summarizing the main findings from the EDA.

## Ideal Profile Analysis

- [ ] Determine the “ideal profile” for soil and climate conditions for crop cultivation.
- [ ] Compare the ideal profile with three selected products:
  - [ ] Analyze and discuss preferences related to humidity, precipitation, temperature, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels.
  - [ ] Utilize statistical analyses and visual representations to support findings.

## Predictive Modeling

- [ ] Develop five predictive models using different algorithms, ensuring:
  - [ ] Each model uses a distinct algorithm as outlined in Chapter 14.
  - [ ] Follow best practices for machine learning projects (data splitting, feature selection, etc.).
- [ ] Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

## Report Writing

- [ ] Document the entire analysis and modeling process in Markdown cells within the Jupyter Notebook.
- [ ] Discuss findings, strengths, and limitations of the analysis and models.

## Submission

- [ ] Ensure the Jupyter Notebook is well-organized with executed code cells and written explanations.
- [ ] Name the file according to the specified format: “<FullName>\_<RM>\_fase<Phase>\_cap<Chapter>.ipynb”
- [ ] Submit the completed Jupyter Notebook by the deadline.
